In this 15 minute session we'll be covering Scope in JavaScript.

You can find the learning objectives [here](./0-learning-objectives.md)

## Prior Knowledge

Students are expected to have a good grasp of JS syntax and be able to use

- Functions
- Variables
- Loops
- Arrays
- If statements and boolean logic

## Delivery Notes

- I've applied the "I do, We do, You do" framework to plan this lesson
- This lesson was written for a class of between 15-20.
  - It uses peer to peer learning at one point
  - It uses Group Response techniques by way of a formative evaluation
- [Active Live Coding](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/14-live/) is used to demonstrate scope in action
  - Students should purposefully be "shocked" to learn that their assumptions are proven wrong
