- Functions
- Variables
- Loops
- Arrays
- If statements and boolean logic

## Delivery Notes

- I've applied the "I do, We do, You do" framework to plan this lesson
- I use [Ellaborative Encoding](https://wp.uplearn.co.uk/science-behind-up-learn/#Elaborative-Encoding-and-Visceralisation) to link the knowledge to what they know
- I use [Call & Response](https://teachlikeachampionch4.blogspot.com/p/technique-23-call-and-response.html) to measure student engagment and as formative assessment
- I use peer to peer learning at one point to share knowledge between students
- This lesson was written for a class of between 15-20.
- [Active Live Coding](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/14-live/) is used to demonstrate scope in action
  - Students should purposefully be "shocked" to learn that their assumptions are proven wrong
