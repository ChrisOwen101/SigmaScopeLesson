# What is Scope?

Can anyone tell me a rule they had at home when they were growing up?

- You have to go to bed at 8pm
- You have to do the washing up before you can have dessert

These rules are set by your parents and apply inside your house - if you go a friends house they might let you stay up until 10pm!

Of course, outside of the house you also have rules to follow. Whats a rule you have to follow when you're outside of the house?

- Don't drive over the speed limit
- Don't drink alcohol if you're under the age of 18

These rules - or laws - are set by the government for the entire country - if you go to a different country they might be different

Finally, there are laws that apply everywhere like

- Universal Declaration of Human Rights

These laws apply everywhere.

This means that if I'm at home then I have three levels of scope - home, national and global. However a Pirate in international waters could drink grog when they're 14 and could go to bed whenever they wanted - but they can't (or shouldn't!) break Human Rights laws.

In JavaScript, we also have three levels of scope - block, local and global. Let's look at those...
